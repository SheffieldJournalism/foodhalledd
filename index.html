            <p>Located at 121 Eyre Street, from a first glance Foodhall has the feel of an oversized jumble sale with its old-fashioned shutters and abstract furniture scattered across the property.</p>
            <p>Yet a closer look draws you in, you immediately become transfixed at the energy and vibrant exuberance that the space entails.</p>
<p>An approach to the premises is met with a delightful welcome, it is hard to distinguish between the volunteers and consumers but that is exactly the way Foodhall wants you to feel.</p>
<p>It becomes clear that this is no ordinary place, the smell of organically produced food pervades the site and you are soon aware of what this place is all about.</p>
            <p>Foodhall is Sheffield’s ‘pay as you feel’ café. A space for the community to come and eat, drink, dance or simply to socialise with others in the neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>Born out of the idea of wanting to tackle the growing issues of social isolation, food poverty and food waste, the site is open to anybody from anywhere regardless of affluence or social class, to come and have a meal with the people whom they share their community with.</p>

                <div> <img src="images/Slider/jar.jpg" alt="" /> </div>
            </div>
<p>Run entirely by volunteers, many of which are young students, the feel-good factor that enamours Foodhall is apparent to anyone who has set eyes on its premises. People from all walks of life are present, sharing stories, laughter and joy through conversation, music and food.</p>
<p>The founders Louis Pohl, Jamie Wilde and Sam Atkinson take it upon themselves to open the cafe three times a week. You only need to spend an afternoon at the site to appreciate the sheer popularity that Foodhall has despite its relatively new standing in Sheffield’s alternative culture.</p>
<p>The current focus of those behind the enterprise is simple; to offer a public space to the public itself, who in turn through their own kindness and generosity will provide Foodhall with what it needs to function as a community space. </p>
<p>Foodhall is part of the Real Junk Food Project network, meaning they follow the key principals of reclaiming food that would otherwise have been binned and lost to the world.</p>
<p>Through crucial donations and contributions, including a partnership with Sainsbury’s, Foodhall is able to provide a fully stocked fridge every time they open up their doors.</p>
<p>The café only serves vegan food and their signature dish is their own take on BBQ pulled pork, which uses jackrfruit instead of meat.<p>

     <h2> CHAPTER ONE:</h2>
        <h1 class="wow zoomInDown">THE IDEA</h1>
  </section>

<section class="content">

<p>Back in December 2014, three graduates from the University of Sheffield decided to begin connecting people through food sharing via the medium of a mobile phone application. Fast forward a year and the trio held their first public event, a Super Lasagne Disco designed to promote the ethics and values of sharing food intertwined with the convivial activities of music and dance. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>The brains behind Foodhall wanted to address the issues of social isolation, food waste and poverty through the transferable skills they had acquired from their University degrees; Louis and Sam studied Architectural Design and Jamie Urban Planning. Their joint interests in people, spaces, the life of the city and the inter-relationships between them helped greatly in motivating the co-founders to break the conventional boundaries that society has in place.</p>
<p>The group emphasised strongly that their goal was to use the skills and knowledge gained from their time at University to tackle these issues in a socially and environmentally beneficial way.</p>

<p>It is a travesty that such a large quantity of food is thrown away without a care and yet so many of our nation’s citizens go hungry or cannot afford to feed themselves and their loved ones.</p>
<p>This is the reason why public places like Foodhall must be given the opportunity and exposure to survive, so that society’s most needy can feel comfortable about eating in a secure environment without apprehension or embarrassment. </p>
<p>Following extensive financial cuts to local authority spending in the city, compounded with a backdrop of regressive austerity measures, Sheffield is suffering from a lack of genuine public space and services.</p>

        <section class="content">
<p>By the end of 2015 they had taken on the public space of 121 Eyre Street without any capital or funding and began the job of refurbishing what was essentially an abandoned warehouse into a viable, safe, public café for the people of Sheffield. </p>

<p>Following months of hard work and “running around like headless chickens trying to source items and products we needed” Foodhall was properly opened in January 2016. Working alongside the charity Camerados for an initial period of six weeks, Foodhall was a place where people could receive informal counselling in a café environment. </p>




            <p>The next 12 months have seen Foodhall grow exponentially but the boys never expected the level of success or popularity that they have witnessed. They enjoyed success at the Sheffield Design Awards in October 2016, winning the Small Project and People’s Choice awards.</p>

        <section class="content">

          <p>The trio aim to build upon the fantastic work they are currently doing and a long-term ambition is to buy the 121 Eyre Street site as a community asset. This will allow the group to forego paying expensive rent costs and allow them to focus all financial aspects towards improving Foodhall as a public space. Another hope is for Foodhall to be open for more than the three days a week it currently occupies. The guys also emphasised that a future aspiration is to have paid staff working at the site.</p>
          <iframe width="840" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rS-B46Y_ASI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <p>This idea that began less than three years ago as a hopeful attempt at bringing together the local community has achieved success on a scale the co-founders could not have possibly envisaged. Projects such as Foodhall give the people of Sheffield not only a public space to share the basic human requirements of shelter, food and drink but also the things that people need to live a fulfilled life; arts, crafts, talks and cultural events. Foodhall is here to stay and Sheffield should be incredibly proud of it.</p>
